# Technical ApproachThe current home-grown system was developed in Microsoft **Access**(tm).  We have decided to convert that system _as-is_ into **PostgreSQL** as a first step.   We then run our **python**-based conversion scripts from there,  taking advantage of the [ArchivesSnake](https://github.com/archivesspace-labs/ArchivesSnake/) package that uses the ArchivesSpace API.## Converting the database to PostgreSQLWe have documented the  [steps for converting from the **Access** database to **PostgreSQL**](db_conversion.md).## Creating data crosswalksBecause the structure of the home-grown database is quite different from that of ArchivesSpace, we are creating a separate database that maps data in the original system with analogous data in ArchivesSpace.An immediate example is the controlled value lists of ArchivesSpace; _e.g._ for the _Linked Agent Archival Record Relators_ list in ArchivesSpace, we need to identify mapping from the **tblLookupValues** for "Creator Type" with the appropriate **enum** in the list.Further, as we develop processing of disparate parts of the archive, such as _subjects_, we want to keep track of the analogous IDs in ArchivesSpace as we associate those with other parts, such as _resources_, to reduce lookup speeds.We have created a **Crosswalk** database for this purpose, using [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html), which is available with the Python installation.
