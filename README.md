# ArchivesSpace JSONModel Converter## InstallationNavigate to the top level of this repository, and run:```bashpip install -e .```After installation, the tool should be available as `ajc`, running `ajc` will emit a help page describing any extant subcommands.## ConfigurationAJC is configured via a YAML file. Some values are hardcoded as defaults and can be omitted - currently, these include:- `asnake_config` - ASnake configuration to be passed to the client- `postgres_config` - Configuration values to be passed directly to psycopg- `crosswalk_config` - Config for the Crosswalk class in this application. Currently only supports `name`, which is the name of a sqlite3 database.By default, AJC looks for a `.archivesspace_jsonmodel_converter.yml` in the user's home directory.  A different file location can be specified via the AJC_CONFIG_FILE variable, or by providing a path to the `ajc` commend via the `--config-file` option.## Conversion of Access DB to postgresql DBWe have documented [the steps for this conversion](docs/db_conversion.md).
